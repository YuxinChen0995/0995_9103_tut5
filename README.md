## P1: Inspiration explanation
```
I love the artist Manoloide's digital art. His artworks are characterized by complex geometric figures and changing colors in ever-changing natural dynamics. This fascinates me deeply.

Three of his works have given me great inspiration.
These artworks have a good visual effect. By using the natural dynamic changes of the line as the core, we create a work that is casual but rich in visual art. The colorful lines overlap and weave together artfully.
I will incorporate these visual inspirations and the use of lines that I observe into my project and animate the scene. I think this will definitely make our project more visually rich.
